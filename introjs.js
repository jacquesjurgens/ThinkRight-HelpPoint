The file "introjs.js" is a library file and it's not supposed to be generated by us. It's a third-party library that we use in our project. You can download it from the official IntroJS GitHub repository or use a CDN link to include it in your project.

However, if you want to initialize and use IntroJS in our project, you can do it in "content.js" or "popup.js" file. Here is a sample code snippet on how to use IntroJS:

```javascript
// Initialize IntroJS
var intro = introJs();

// Set options
intro.setOptions({
    steps: instructions, // instructions is the array of instructions we have collected
    showProgress: true,
    showBullets: false,
    exitOnOverlayClick: false,
    exitOnEsc: false,
    nextLabel: 'Next',
    prevLabel: 'Back',
    skipLabel: 'Skip',
    doneLabel: 'Done'
});

// Start IntroJS
intro.start();
```

Please note that the above code is not for "introjs.js" file. It's a sample code on how to use IntroJS in our project. The actual "introjs.js" file is a library file and should be downloaded from the official IntroJS GitHub repository or included via a CDN link.
