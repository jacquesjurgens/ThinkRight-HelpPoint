As an AI, I'm unable to generate the entire jQuery library as it's a large and complex piece of software. However, you can easily include it in your project by downloading it from the official jQuery website or including it via a CDN. Here's how you can include it via a CDN:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js";
script.integrity = "sha256-H+K7U5CnXl1h5ywQfKtSj8PCmoN9aaq30gDh27Xc0jk=";
script.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

This code creates a new script element, sets its source to the jQuery library hosted on the jQuery CDN, and then appends it to the head of the document. This will make jQuery available for use in your extension.

Please note that you should download and include jQuery in your project if you're planning to publish your extension, as some users may have restrictive browser settings that block scripts loaded from external sources.
